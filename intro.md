## A Galaxy in Peril… A Pilot with Nine Lives!

The ruthless warlord known as the Iron Jackal has stolen the Warp Core - an artifact with the power to twist space and time itself. With the galaxy hanging in the balance, only one reckless pilot dares to hunt him down… Benji!

Join Benji, Maggie the strategist, and Torx the engineer as you blast across starfields, dive through unstable war zones, and chase the Jackal into the heart of cosmic distortion. The further you pursue him, the more reality itself unravels—stars ripple, space bends, and time breaks apart.

Upgrade your ship, take down swarms of enemies, and gamble with Benji's nine lives as you carve your fate among the cosmos. Every bargain could make you stronger… or push you closer to doom.

Will you bring the Iron Jackal to justice and reclaim the Warp Core - or lose everything in the void?

**The hunt is on. The galaxy won’t wait.**

## Gameplay/Features

- Death isn’t the end! Maggie lets Benji gamble his 9 lives for a twist on your next run
- Upgrade your ship with Torx's item upgrades after every zone

## Notes

This is my 2nd js13k entry. I focused on visuals and music this time and quickly hit the 13k limit - so some music, dialog, items, and exchanges had to be cut. Creating the art and soundtrack was a blast, and I hope you enjoy the ride as much as I did making it!

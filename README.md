# Super Benji

## Story

The Iron Jackal has stolen the Heart of Pawrus, an ancient crystalline star-core that powers interstellar warp lanes. Without it, whole colonies risk isolation and collapse.
Benji and his sidekick Torx, an ingenious turtle mechanic, must chase him down before he uses the Heart to forge a galaxy-crushing superweapon.

Area 1: Starfield Frontiers

The chase begins. Jackal’s raiding fleets and scavenger drones are stripping systems bare to fuel his mega-ship. Jackal broadcasts a taunt to Benji, mocking the Feline Star League’s weakness. Torx says this isn’t just about survival — Jackal is building something.

Area 2: Verdantia Planet System

Jackal’s armies are invading worlds to extract planetary cores for fuel.

Story beat: Benji discovers the Iron Jackal’s endgame — his mega-ship is being built around the Heart of Purrima. Torx warns: “If that thing powers up, the galaxy’s in the doghouse — literally.”

Area 3: The Ironfang Megaship

The Jackal’s mobile base, bigger than a moon, powered by the Heart.

Mecha Tileset, columns to dodge

Story beat: Benji and Torx infiltrate the ship. Final showdown with the Iron Jackal himself.

## Story

In a distant frontier of the galaxy, a ruthless warlord known as The Iron Jackal has stolen the Warp Core—a powerful artifact capable of bending space and time itself. With the core in his claws, he threatens to reshape the universe to his own design, or destroy it in the process.

You play as Benji, a daring pilot who won’t stand by while chaos spreads. Alongside Maggie, the strategist, and Torx, the engineer, you’ll chase the Jackal across starfields, through unstable war zones, and into the heart of cosmic distortion.

As you draw closer, the very fabric of reality begins to warp—stars ripple, space bends, and time threatens to unravel. The Jackal taunts you from the shadows, daring you to follow him into the unknown.

The hunt builds toward a final showdown aboard the Jackal’s massive flagship, where his ultimate weapon waits. Only Benji has the courage to face him and reclaim the Warp Core before the galaxy collapses into madness.
